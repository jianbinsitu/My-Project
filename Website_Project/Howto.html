        <br><br>Note: The 1st payment of $450 will be returned if you are not accepted. See “Cost & Payment” for more information.  Students are advised to ensure they will have sufficient funds for the program when submitting their application.)

        <br><br>Your application should also include the following documents:

        <br><br>1.Letter of recommendation The recommendation letter can be submitted separately a bit later. The professor can also email the recommendation directly to <a href="mailto:CUNYinChina@brooklyn.cuny.edu" target="_self">Prof. Lu</a>
        <br><br>2.Transcript (OK to include an unofficial copy you print online).
        <br><br>3.Personal statement Past examples: <a href="http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc-china/extra_files/HowtoApply_files/Personal%20Statement-01-Andrew.doc" target="_self">Andrew</a>, <a href="http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc-china/extra_files/HowtoApply_files/Personal%20Statement-02Jessica.doc" target="_self">Jessica</a>
        <br><br>4.Copy of passport photo page 
        <br><br><b style="font-size:22px">Important Note:</b>
        <br><br>If you have a passport, include a copy of the photo page.
        <br><br>Make sure you check the expiration date of your passport against our program dates. The passport must be valid until 6 months beyond the trip dates. If not, renew it immediately.
        <br><br>If you do not have a passport, or if your passport has expired, you can still submit your program application. And note the following:
        <br><br>If you do not have a passport, apply for one immediately and be aware that a copy of valid passport is needed for trip operators in China to make your trip booking 45 days prior to departure. It is very important that you request expedited service.
        <br><br>If you are renewing your passport, be sure to give us the information (photo) page of your old passport; the number of the old passprot will be used by the trip operators in China to makie your trip booking (including train tickets, etc), and you must bring your old passport, along with the new passport, to China. In this case (i.e., passport being renewed), you can give us the photo page of your new passport 30 days before departure.
        <br><br>The study abroad office on many campuses oftern has a passport day and they can help get the passort for you very quickly, much faster than a passport agency.  So check with the study abroad office on your campus.
        <br><br><b style="font-size:22px">More Information:</b>
        <br><br>The only requirement for the China program is a GPA of 2.5; students with GPA below 2.5 may enroll with the program director’s approval. There is NO Chinese language requirement (classes in China are conducted in English by Brooklyn College faculty).

        <br><br>Students, both graduate and undergraduate, from any college can apply. We accept applications from all CUNY campuses and any other U.S. colleges. All applications are treated with the same criteria.


        <br><br>Past participants included students from over 10 CUNY campuses and from Columbia Univ., many SUNY campuses, NYU, FIT, Cornell Univ., Rutgers Univ., Manhattan School of Music, Pace Univ., St. Johns Univ., George Mason Univ., Colby College, Miami Univ., Syracuse Univ., Minnesota, etc.

        <br><br>For the international flights to China, students from other states can depart from their local airport; they do not need to make a connection in NYC.
