          First, a news article on study abroad in China

          <a href="http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc-china/extra_files/comments_files/China.html">China grows as study hotspot for U.S. students</a> by Margo Buchanan (International Herald Tribune -- Dec 7, 2005)

          Some participants wrote about their experiences and gave advice to those who are planning to make a Study Abroad trip to China . Here are comments made by the students, with no additions or deletions:

          One student at CUNY MaCaulay Honors college wanted to share this:<a href="http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/bcchina/" target="_self"> http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/bcchina/</a>

          The CUNY-Brooklyn College study abroad program is a unique opportunity to explore China's history and contemporary culture and society over the winter or summer break. The journey will take you through millennium of Chinese history in Beijing, the PRC's capital as well as the former capitals of Xi'an and Nanjing. You will see the lovely gardens of Yangzhou and Suzhou and walk in the metropolis of Shanghai. With the offering of various exciting courses that relate directly to Chinese history and culture the classroom and the country will come alive to you during your weeks in Nanjing. You will meet many exciting new people and see another side of yourself as you grow as a cultured individual. The China trip led by Prof. Shuming Lu will be one of the highlights of your college years, if not your life.

          The trip to China had three components: art, history and culture. We were exposed to traditional arts such as silk embroidery painting, cloisonné, jade sculpture and jewelry craft, the making of silk fabrics and clothing, lacquer ware. We visited factories and showrooms where these processes were explained and exhibited. The history component consisted of visits to historical monuments such as The Forbidden City, Tian'anmen Square, the remains of Chairman Mao, the site of the Nanjing Massacre. Through visiting these sites we came to understand certain facts about Chinese history.

          One example of this is the surprising discovery that many people revere Chairman Mao, founder of the Chinese Communist Party because he restored the nation's dignity by making China a military power and preventing foreign invasions. The cultural component consisted of learning about the Chinese way of eating - using chopsticks, eating communally and the diverse types of food eaten. We also visited many gardens wherein the Yin and Yang principle of Chinese culture is seen. Many gardens are composed of "hard" rock formations contrasted against the "softness" of water - via lakes, streams and ponds.

          Through comparative analysis of New York vs the Chinese cities that were visited, Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai, I came to understand the differences between city life in the U.S. and city life in China . One major difference is that streets accommodate bicycles, motor bikes and scooters. These vehicles are licensed and considered a part of pedestrian traffic. They are used by professionals as well as non-professionals to get to work. As a result of this type of daily exercise as well as public dancing and exercise, the Chinese are much thinner and obesity is rare.

          Overall, the trip was educational and informative. The accommodations were very good and the food was plentiful and healthy.

          My study abroad trip to China was a very rich experience for me. Growing up in New York, I had always assumed and taken for granted that China would be very similar to Chinatown. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find a country full of beautiful and friendly people, rapidly developing cities, amazing architecture, peaceful gardens, and a tasty cuisine that varies from region to region. The most memorable part of the trip was interacting with the Chinese people. While there was a language barrier in many of the situations, the people were eager to help and often went above and beyond to make sure that needs were met. People were consistently patient with me, despite how fast-paced the culture is. I am already looking forward to making another trip to China so that I can continue to explore what China has to offer.

          I have also made many new friends on this trip. Since we were such a large and diverse group of students, I learned not only about the richness and diversity of Chinese culture, but also about the different cultural backgrounds of the students who I was traveling with. I will never forget how much I have learned from them and the wonderful times we had together.
